        On October 17th 2023 I went to the hospital for 
        an echography; the radiologist asked me almost immediately
        if they could perform a biopsy.
        So they stuck a needle in my breast and took out a few tissue samples.
        It was painful as hell and I ended up crying, confused, and trembling on the bed.
        The doctor asked me why I went alone for a check of this entity.
        Well, I didn't know better, but there was my first lesson:

        **if you can, bring someone with you to medical appointments**.
      notes: >
        The data I chose for this day are two scans from the echography, they both _clearly_
        show the lesion; the second picture also shows the measurements the radiologist took.

       The radiologist that saw me on October 17th, booked me a mammography for 3 days later.
       I had never done this exam before, and it was very painful, especially because my breast 
       was still suffering from the biopsy. But a mammography can highlight things that an
       echography cannot, so it was necessary.  
       In the meantime, the results of my biopsy came in, and there was no doubt:  
       "**it's cancer, a breast carcinoma, and unfortunately a triple negative one**", said the doctor.
      notes: > 
       The data I chose for this event are the four scans of the mammography and a revised version
       of the biopsy results. The biopsy analysis started on 2023-10-17 at 5:50pm, and it kept being
       updated until 2023-11-01. I have highlighted in red the medical decisions. 
       At the end you'll also find a single value, the level of the CA 15-3 tumor marker in my blood.
       It will come back quite a bit in the following months.

       The gynecologist explained the therapy plan and the additional exams that needed to happen
       as soon as possible. I was not alone, this time around, and I am forever grateful about it: 
       I didn't understand all of it, to be honest, too caught up in a whirlwind of thoughts, fears, questions.  
       I was sent to the breast clinic, where a breast nurse was ready to talk to me. 
       I just couldn't stop crying. Everybody kept telling me I was going to lose my hair. It's the only thing
       I can still remember very clearly.  I was given a folder and a box: everything I needed to know was in there. 
      notes: >
       There was a book inside the box. A book on living with and after breast cancer.
       I have read it all. Back and forth. I still have it at home, in the living room library.
       Looking back, I am not sure reading it was the best choice for me at the time. Who knows.

       On October 23rd 2023 a series of medical exams started for me. The overall goal was to exclude
       cancer metastases in my body and to understand a bit better the general status of the disease.
       I started with a **bone scan scintigraphy**. It went down more or less like this:  
       I was injected a radioactive substance, then sent home for a few hours,
       where I was allowed to eat and I had to drink a lot of water, the more, the better.
       For the exam to take place, the bladder needs to be empty (a full bladder can obscure
       the pelvis and the surrounding pelvic bones), so they asked me to pee right before getting on the table.
       The exam lasted around 45 minutes, which seemed an eternity as in the middle of it I realized I had
       to pee again, and I obviously couldn't. Also, the camera moved very very close to my face without touching
       it: overall, an horrible experience.  
       A few days later I had the results: the medical report stated that there were
       "**no arguments for bone metastases**".
      notes: >
       You can see some points in my body lighting up, but apparently this was not related to cancer. 
       Fun fact: I remember the technician in the room asking me to try and focus and 
       not piss myself on the table (because apparently this can happen). They said something like:       
       "there's no shame in it, but I really don't want you to have to do this all over again." Yeah, I didn't
       want that either.

       In the meantime, the multidisciplinary oncology consultation took place at the hospital.
       Radiologists, oncologists, radiotherapists, gynecologists, they all sat together to discuss, 
       amongst others, also my case.  
       
       _what was the verdict? what therapy plan they were going to propose to me?_
       It's all in a letter that I have summarized and translated to English,
       redacting privacy information and trimming
       it down to the essential core. Believe it or not: **my entire future depended on this plan**.
      notes: >
       Please note I have not translated this very well. I don't need to, and I don't want to.

       I had a short break of a few days, and the medical checkups resumed on October 27th, when a few things
       happened. The first of these things was a chest radiology exam, which showed that **no pulmonary lesions** were present or suspected.
       Another piece of the puzzle falling into place.
      notes: >
       I included here the two x-ray images, along with a recap of the protocol they used for the exam.
       I will be honest, I don't understand it (all), but I couldn't help but thinking that this is data
       that plays a crucial role, too: a different protocol might have shown things differently?
       more of it, less of it?

       On the same day, I also had an abdomen ultrasound of my liver, gallbladder, and bile duct, which
       together can paint a pretty accurate status of your hepatic health - or lack thereof.
      notes: >
       Like with any ultrasound exam carried over by a physician, the visit was pretty painless
       and I got the results on the spot: everything looked pretty normal. For this exam, I selected random
       data: I chose 3 images that looked the funniest to me, but I honestly have no idea what they mean.

      description: >
       To close off this day, I also did a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam with a contrast medium.
       The question to answer here was mainly: **is my tumor a solitary lesion?
       or part of a bigger, scattered group? and how big is it? are my axillary lymph nodes healthy or not?**
       This is _the_ imaging modality for dense breast imaging: it's also, unfortunately, very expensive. 
      notes: >
       The doctors panicked here a little bit, as the MRI showed weird inflammatory activities around my 
       axillary zones: it turned out this was due to the double shots of vaccine I had 24 hours before
       (both for COVID and for the seasonal flu). Admittedly not a great timing, but I needed to help my
       immune system as fast as possible before starting chemotherapy.  
       Yes, those up there are my boops as I breathe in and out on the machine. The exam was long,
       uncomfortable, and loud as hell.

       On this day I met my oncologist for the first time.  

       I think I spent most of the appointment crying, first, and asking questions, afterwards.
       They explained - again, and in a greater amount of detail - the therapy plan, the steps still required
       for the actual plan to start, the side effects, and the overall goal we were trying to achieve: slow down
       the tumor proliferation, and hopefully kill it all.  

       _You will lose all your hair, and it's going to happen very, very fast._     
      notes: >
       I have a full report from this appointment, and a list of questions I asked the doctor along with
       the answers I received. I am still not sure if I want to share this in great detail, so for now 
       I just took the report, extracted the very last bit of it and translated it to English.
       I think you can appreciate that it kind of reflects well the type of patient I have 
       always been: curious, communicative, participating. The hospital and my doctors have always 
       respected my autonomy and encouraged me to exercise full agency during my treatment.

       Before starting chemotherapy, we needed to make sure my heart was healthy enough to endure it.
       So I went to the hospital for a full cardiological exam: an electrocardiogram followed
       by an echography. We didn't expect anything to show up - I have never suffered from cardiological
       issues - but basically, like with everything, "you never know".             
      notes: >
       The data for this day are an electrocardiogram on the usual pink paper, and an echocardiogram, which is
       used to highlight the structure, function, and blood flow of the heart.
       The second image shows a color flow doppler, with in blue the blood that flows from the probe
       and in red the blood that flows towards it. Everything was healthy and ready to sustain chemotherapy.

       At this point of the ordeal we still needed to take care of two things, and both of these 
       had to do with implanting stuff in my body.  
       The first thing we inserted was a little clip in my breast, a tiny titanium marker used to pinpoint
       the exact position of the tumor. If we were going, hopefully, to kill the whole tumor, the
       clip was going to guide the surgeon find the correct area for removal later on. Furthermore, 
       the clip was going to be monitored during imaging exams in the course of chemotherapy to understand 
       changes over time.
      notes: >
       This procedure happens with the same principle of a biopsy: a needle is inserted in the breast, but
       instead of taking tissue material away, the needle leaves the small clip behind.
       In the records I have selected from this procedure you can see the lesion in my breast, the long needle
       inside it, and eventually the clip in the middle of the tumor.

      description: >
       The very last thing before chemotherapy could start was the insertion of a port-a-cath in my body.
       A port is an implantable device that allows long-term central venous access,
       very useful for administering medications like chemotherapy, for drawing blood, or for
       providing intravenous fluids.
       With an implanted port, the medicine goes straight to a central vein, bypassing smaller,
       peripheral veins, and protecting them from damage.
      notes: >
       I received my port-a-cath with local anestesia: surgery started at 12:32pm and finished at 13:12pm
       on November 7th 2023 (I know this because I have read the surgeon's report).
       The x-ray image I have uploaded has been taken during surgery and shows the port in place.  
       I have called my port-a-cath **Portia** - very clever, I know.  
       
       Two years later it's still in my body. One day I'll bid it goodbye, I think (hope?).

       Chemotherapy day (finally) arrived: the sooner I started, the better, obviously.
       Not sure what happened on the day, but I fainted while getting ready. The pain from the port surgery,
       the tiredness, the stress of it all, I just went down on my face.   
       My oncologist suspected a pneumothorax (a collection of air outside the lung but within
       the pleural cavity) so I was sent to radiology for some x-rays. 
      notes: >
       They checked my lungs during inspiration (first image) and expiration (second image):
       you can clearly see Portia with the catheter getting into my subclavian vein.  

       Luckly enough, I didn't have a pneumothorax, so we went ahead with chemotherapy.  
       
       I did 12 sessions of weekly therapy + 4 sessions of biweekly therapy.
