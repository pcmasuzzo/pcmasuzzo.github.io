        On October 17th 2023 I went to the hospital for 
        an echography; the radiologist asked me almost immediately
        if they could perform a biopsy.
        So they stuck a needle in my breast and took out a few tissue samples.
        It was painful as hell and I ended up crying, confused, and trembling on the bed.
        The doctor asked me why I went alone for a check of this entity.
        Well, I didn't know better, but there was my first lesson:

        **if you can, bring someone with you to medical appointments, always**

        The files I chose for this day are two scans from the echography, they both _clearly_
        show the lesion; the second picture also shows the measurements the radiologist took.

       The radiologist that saw me on October 17th, booked me a mammography for 3 days later.
       I had never done this exam before, and it was very painful, especially because my breast 
       was still suffering from the biopsy. But a mammography can highlight things that an
       echography cannot, so it was necessary.  
       
       In the meantime, the results of my biopsy came in, and there was no doubt:  
       "**it's cancer, a breast carcinoma, and unfortunately a triple negative one**", said the doctor.
      notes: > 
       The data I chose for this event are the four scans of the mammography and a revised version
       of the biopsy results. The biopsy analysis started on 2023-10-17 at 5:50pm, and it kept being
       updated until 2023-11-01. I have highlighted in red the medical decisions (_besluit_, in Dutch). 
       At the end you'll also find a single value, the level of the CA 15-3 tumor marker in my blood.
       Keep it in mind: it will come back later on.

       The gynecologist explained the therapy plan and the additional exams that needed to happen
       as soon as possible. I was not alone, this time around, and I am forever grateful about it: 
       I didn't understand all of it, to be honest, too caught up in a whirlwind of thoughts, fears, questions.
       
       I was sent to the breast clinic, where a breast nurse was ready to talk to me. 
       I was given a folder and a box: everything I needed to know was in there. 
       I just couldn't stop crying. 
      notes: >
       There was a book inside the box. A book on living with and after breast cancer.
       I have read it all. Back and forth. I still have it at home, in the living room library.

       On October 23rd 2023 a series of medical exams started for me. The overall goal was to exclude
       cancer metastases in my body and to understand a bit better the general status of the disease.

       I started with a bone scan scintigraphy. It went down more or less like this:
       I was injected a radioactive substance, then sent home for a few hours,
       where I was allowed to eat and I had to drink a lot of water: the more, the better.
       For the exam to take place, the bladder needs to be empty (a full bladder can obscure
       the pelvis and surrounding pelvic bones), so they asked me to pee right before getting on the table.
       The exam lasted around 45 minutes, which seemed an eternity as in the middle of it I realized I had
       to pee again, and I obviously couldn't. Also, the camera moved very very close to my face without touching
       it: overall, an horrible experience.

       A few days later I had the results: the medical report stated that there were
       "**no arguments for bone metastases**".
      notes: >
       I remember the technician in the room telling me to be strong, and asking me to try and focus and 
       not piss myself on the table (because apparently this can happen). They said something like:
       
       "there's no shame in it, but I really don't want you to have to do this all over again.""
