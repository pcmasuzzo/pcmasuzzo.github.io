        On October 17th 2023 I went to the hospital for 
        an echography; the radiologist asked me almost immediately
        if they could perform a biopsy.
        So they stuck a needle in my breast and took out a few tissue samples.
        It was painful as hell and I ended up crying, confused, and trembling on the bed.
        The doctor asked me why I went alone for a check of this entity.
        Well, I didn't know better, but there was my first lesson:

        **if you can, bring someone with you to medical appointments, always**

        The files I chose for this day are two scans from the echography, they both _clearly_
        show the lesion; the second picture also shows the measurements the radiologist took.

       The radiologist that saw me on October 17th, booked me a mammography for 3 days later.
       I had never done this exam before, and it was very painful, especially because my breast 
       was still suffering from the biopsy. But a mammography can highlight things that an
       echography cannot, so it was necessary.  
       
       In the meantime, the results of my biopsy came in, and there was no doubt:  
       "**it's cancer, a breast carcinoma, and unfortunately a triple negative one**", said the doctor.
      notes: > 
       The data I chose for this event are the four scans of the mammography and a revised version
       of the biopsy results. The biopsy analysis started on 2023-10-17 at 5:50pm, and it kept being
       updated until 2023-11-01.

       The gynecologist explained the therapy plan and the additional exams that needed to happen
       as soon as possible. I was not alone, this time around, and I am forever grateful about it: 
       I didn't understand all of it, to be honest, too caught up in a whirlwind of thoughts, fears, questions.
       
       I was sent to the breast clinic, where a breast nurse was ready to talk to me. 
       I was given a folder and a box: everything I needed to know was in there. 
       I just couldn't stop crying. 
      notes: >
       There was a book inside the box. A book on living with and after breast cancer.
       I have read it all. Back and forth. I still have it at home, in the living room library.
