      description: > The 17th of October I went to the hospital for 
                    an echography; the radiologist didn't like what they saw
                    and asked me immediately if they could perform a biopsy.
                    This means they stuck a needle in my breast to remove a sample of the tissue.
                    It was painful as hell and I ended up confused and trembling on the bed.
                    The doctor asked me why I went alone for a check of this entity.
                    Well, I didn't know better, but there was my first learned lesson:
                    **if you can have somebody with you during medical examinations, bring them along**
