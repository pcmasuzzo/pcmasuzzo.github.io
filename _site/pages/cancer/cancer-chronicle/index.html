<p>This page chronicles a journey from the moment of my cancer diagnosis through the treatments that led to my remission. Please note this isn’t a medical manual, nor is it a benchmark for how quickly or slowly a cancer journey should unfold. <strong>It is simply my story</strong>.</p>

<p>As part of my <a href="/pages/cancer/cancer-archive/">cancer archive</a>, this is a <strong>personal reconstruction of events</strong>. My goal is to remember the long road I traveled, allowing myself to regain control, while hopefully helping someone else navigating the overwhelming experience of a (breast) cancer diagnosis.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>profound comfort can be found in knowledge, and immense power in the ability to access it</p>

<p>Explore the timeline below to see the pivotal moments that started in October 2023, the month I learned I had triple-negative breast cancer. You can click on each date (each dot) to <strong>uncover the (medical) records from that day</strong>. These files, images, and notes were the individual pieces that formed the larger picture of my diagnosis.</p>

<p>Please note that you cannot scroll these images as you would do in a regular user experience.
This is on purpose: I want you to open each data point on its own, digest it, if possible, close it, and then move on to the next one.</p>

In the meantime, the results of my biopsy came in, and there was no doubt:   “<strong>it’s cancer, a breast carcinoma, and unfortunately a triple negative one</strong>”, said the doctor.</p><br />

The overall goal was to exclude cancer metastases in my body and to understand a bit better the general status of the disease. I started with a <strong>bone scan scintigraphy</strong>. It went down more or less like this:   I was injected a radioactive substance, then sent home for a few hours, where I was allowed to eat and I had to drink a lot of water: the more, the better. For the exam to take place, the bladder needs to be empty (a full bladder can obscure the pelvis and surrounding pelvic bones), so they asked me to pee right before getting on the table. The exam lasted around 45 minutes, which seemed an eternity as in the middle of it I realized I had to pee again, and I obviously couldn’t. Also, the camera moved very very close to my face without touching it: overall, an horrible experience.   A few days later I had the results: the medical report stated that there were “<strong>no arguments for bone metastases</strong>”.</p><br />
