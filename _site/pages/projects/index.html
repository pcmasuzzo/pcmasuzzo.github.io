        <p>I have to be honest, I am not sure what classifies as a project :D
but here are some things that keep me busy and help me navigate existential dread.</p>

<h3 id="i-got-up">I GOT UP</h3>
<p>I copied the japanese artist On Kawara and stamped 31 postcards with the exact hour in which I got up for the whole month of july 2025.</p>

<p><a href="/pages/i-got-up/">have a look at the collection here</a></p>

<h3 id="my-cancer-archive">my cancer archive</h3>
<p>I didnâ€™t put this up in the <em>about</em> section, but a big part of my identity boils down to me being a triple negative breast cancer survivor. During my active cancer treatment - the hardest time of my life - I found solace in writing and in data, and sometimes in the combination of the two.</p>

<p>This is my attempt at constructing my cancer archive.</p>

<p><a href="/pages/cancer/cancer-archive/">you can explore it here </a></p>
