# welcome to this space
I finally decided to create a space to put some of the things I write and create.
This is my attempt number _only god knows_, will it be the final one?
I have previously written [here](https://runningoutofshrimp.wordpress.com/) and also [here](https://theyjustwriteitoff.blogspot.com/). And before that on some other platforms, too, but nothing too important.

## what are you going to find here
I honestly have absolutely no idea. Alright, maybe a little bit.

- **[newsletter](/pages/newsletter/)**: I write on [substack](https://paolamasuzzo.substack.com/), though mostly in italian
- **[projects](/pages/projects/)**: sometimes I do semi-artistic things (blushing profoundly)
- **[about](/pages/about/)**: the stuff I come up about myself; the bits I think are worth sharing
