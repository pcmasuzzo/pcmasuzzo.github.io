my name is Paola Chiara, but everybody calls me Paola (I know you're thinking of [this](https://en.meming.world/wiki/My_Name_is_Giovanni_Giorgio)).

I am (finally?) setting this up to have a space in the world wide web to put everything I create - or at least some of the things I create.

It's my attempt number *I can't even recall*, because every time I try to crystallize parts of me in some form or shape, those parts run away and I am left with a profound sense of unaccomplishment and anxiety.

The closest thing I have written to some sort of _self-portrait_ is [this one](https://paolamasuzzo.substack.com/p/self-portrait): I'd love to hear what you think of it.

Well, I hope you enjoy being here!
