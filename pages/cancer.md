The 20th of October 2023 I received a diagnosis of triple negative breast cancer.

It seems daft to spell it out, but my life has never been the same.
My body and my heart are not the same, and my mind is definitely not the same. 

I have been surviving cancer for two years, now. Along the way, between chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and across surgeries and again chemotherapy, I found solace in the written words, in art, in companionship. 

Here are some of the little silly things I made that kept me floating when I thought I was going to drown.
