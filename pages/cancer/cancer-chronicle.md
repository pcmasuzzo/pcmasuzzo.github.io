### reconstructing a journey
This page chronicles a journey from the moment of my cancer diagnosis through the start of the treatments that led to my remission. Please note this isn't a medical manual, nor is it a benchmark for how quickly or slowly a cancer journey should unfold. **It is simply my story**.

As part of my [cancer archive](/pages/cancer/cancer-archive/), this is a **personal reconstruction of some events**. My goal is to remember the long road I traveled, allowing myself to regain control, while hopefully helping someone else navigating the overwhelming experience of a (breast) cancer diagnosis.

 > profound comfort can be found in knowledge,  
 > and immense power in the ability to access it

### how does this work
Explore the timeline below to see the pivotal moments that started in October 2023, the month I learned I had triple-negative breast cancer. You can click on each date (each dot) to **uncover the (medical) records from that day**. These files, images, and notes were the individual pieces that formed the larger picture of my diagnosis. Please note that you cannot scroll these images as you would do in a regular user experience.
This is on purpose: I want you to open each data point on its own, digest it, if possible, close it, and then move on to the next one.  

If you want to know more about how I gathered and/or generated this data, [go over here](/pages/cancer/cancer-chronicle-methodology/).

This timeline spans nine days over the course of three weeks, from the day of my first breast ultrasound to the day of my first chemotherapy session.

The other part of the journey - the one that led to my remission - doesn't follow a linear path and I am not able to reconstruct it with the same approach, so I am still figuring out how to do that.
