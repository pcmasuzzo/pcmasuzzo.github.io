### reconstructing a journey
This page chronicles the journey from my cancer diagnosis to the start of active treatment. Though relatively brief, this time was filled with every emotion imaginable. The second part of my journey - the path to remission - has proven much harder to revisit. I haven't found the right way to reconstruct those months with the same clarity I've managed here, so I'm still working out how to tell that story.

Please note this isn't a medical manual, nor is it a benchmark for how quickly or slowly a cancer journey should unfold. **It is simply my story**.

As part of my [cancer archive](/pages/cancer/cancer-archive/), this is a **personal reconstruction of some events**. My goal is to remember the long road I traveled, giving myself the opportunity to regain agency over my own story, while hopefully helping someone else navigating the overwhelming experience of a (breast) cancer diagnosis.

### how does this work
Explore the timeline below to go through the moments that started in October 2023, the month I learned I had triple-negative breast cancer. To populate the timeline, I have crafted a selection of data, mostly medical records, that were generated on specific days. On the timeline, you can click on each dot (each day) to uncover these data: files, images, notes, everything that started forming the larger picture of my diagnosis and my disease. If on a specific day more than one event took place, you can see them stacked vertically one after each other.

Please note that you cannot scroll these images as you would do in a regular user experience.
This is on purpose: I want you to open each data point on its own, digest it, if possible, close it, and then move on to the next one. This timeline spans **nine days over the course of three weeks**, from the day of my first breast ultrasound to the day of my first chemotherapy session.
