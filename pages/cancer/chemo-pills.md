### oral chemotherapy
After the first big chemotherapy and a cycle of radiotherapy (my _neoadjuvant_ therapies), I underwent breast surgery to remove my tumor. At this stage, we were hoping for my tumor to be completely gone, or, in other words, for my body to show a full, complete response to the treatment.

Unfortunately, this was not the case. After surgery, the doctors explained to me that there was still _residual invasive disease_ in my body, which meant my chances for a relapse were too high if we didn't do anything else. 

My oncologist advised an extra six months of oral chemotherapy, and in August 2024 I started with _capecitabine_.

### two pictures a day
When I started taking oral chemotherapy, I thought I needed something to help me record the moment, something that would remind me I was going through the extra pain for a reason, in order to survive, to have a real chance at it. 

So I started taking pictures of the pills, two pictures a day for every day of chemotherapy.
I started on August 7th 2024 and finished on January 14th 2025.

Here is a little schema to help you visualize it:

```
8 cycles of 3 weeks each = 24 weeks = 6 months
1 cycle = 3 weeks = 2 weeks with pills + 1 week without pills
2 weeks with pills x 8 cycles = 14 days with pills x 8 cycles = 112 days with pills
112 days with pills x 2 pictures a day = 224 pictures
```

**I ended up with 224 pictures, yes**.

I am calling this my _chemo pills collage_, which I discovered is also a pretty visual and intuitive (for me!) way to look back in time (so perhaps I could also call it _chemo pills calendar_?).

I annotated some of the images: you can click the button below to look at some of the _hotspots_ in the collage, and if you hover with your mouse you can see what little memory they unlock!

<button id="toggle-hotspots" class="hotspot-toggle-btn">show hotspots</button>

### 12 hours away
Based on the photos I took, I was also able to reconstruct the exact timestamps at which I took my medication on each day of chemotherapy. Using these timestamps, I then calculated the time interval between the morning and evening doses for that day.

_Why did this matter?_ At the hospital they told me it was important for me to take the pills with a lot of water and with **roughly 12 hours** between the two moments. Well, I am a sucker for instructions, and the distribution of the time lags shows it!

Not sure what you'd want to do with it, but nevertheless :)
