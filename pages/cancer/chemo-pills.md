### oral chemotherapy
After the first big chemotherapy and a cycle of radiotherapy (my _neoadjuvant_ therapies), I underwent breast surgery to remove my tumor. At this stage, we were hoping for my tumor to be completely gone, or, in other words, for my body to show a full, complete response to the treatment.

Unfortunately, this was not the case. After surgery, the doctors explained to me that there was still _residual invasive disease_ in my body, which meant my chances for a relapse were too high if we didn't do anything else. 

My oncologist advised an extra six months of oral chemotherapy, and in August 2024 I started assuming _capecitabine_.

### two pictures a day
When I started assuming the oral chemotherapy, I thought I needed something to help me record the moment, something that would remind me I was going through the extra pain for a reason, in order to survive, to have a real chance at it. 

So I started taking pictures of the pills, two pictures a day for every day of chemotherapy. Here is a little schema to help you visualize it:
```
8 cycles of 3 weeks each = 24 weeks = 6 months
1 cycle = 3 weeks = 2 weeks with pills + 1 week without pills
2 weeks with pills x 8 cycles = 14 days with pills x 8 cycles = 112 days with pills
112 days with pills x 2 pictures a day = 224 pictures
```


I ended up with 224 pictures, yes.

Here is the full _chemo collage_, which I am now busy annotating.
