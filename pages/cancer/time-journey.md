### reconstructing a journey
This page chronicles my journey from a cancer diagnosis through the treatments that led to remission. Please note this isn't a medical manual, nor is it a benchmark for how quickly or slowly a cancer journey should unfold.   **It is simply my story**.

As part of my [cancer archive](/pages/cancer/cancer-archive/), this is a **personal reconstruction of events**. My goal is to remember the long road I traveled, while hopefully helping someone else navigating the overwhelming experience of a (breast) cancer diagnosis.

 > I believe there is profound comfort in knowledge, and immense power in our ability to access it.

### how does this work
Explore the timeline below to see the pivotal moments that started in October 2023, the month I learned I had triple-negative breast cancer. You can click on each date (each dot) to **uncover the medical records from that day**. These files, images, and notes were the individual pieces that formed the larger picture of my diagnosis.

If you want to know more about how I gathered all this data, [go over here](/pages/cancer/time-journey-methodology/) :).
