### reconstructing a journey
This page chronicles my journey from a cancer diagnosis through the treatments that led to remission. Please note this isn't a medical manual, nor is it a benchmark for how quickly or slowly a cancer journey should unfold.   **It is simply my story**.

As part of my [cancer archive](/pages/cancer/cancer-archive/), this is a **personal reconstruction of events**. My goal is to remember the long road I traveled, while hopefully helping someone else navigating the overwhelming experience of a (breast) cancer diagnosis.

 > I believe there is profound comfort in knowledge, and immense power in our ability to access it.

### how does this work
Explore the timeline below to see the pivotal moments that started in October 2023, the month I learned I had triple-negative breast cancer. You can click on each date (each dot) to **uncover the medical records from that day**. These files, images, and notes were the individual pieces that formed the larger picture of my diagnosis.

But before you dive in, let me share how I gathered all this data.
As I mention in [this other page](/pages/cancer/blood-data/), in Flanders, Belgium - where I live - patients can have access to their medical data through a **digital collaboration platform** called CoZo. Different types of data can be found there:
- files of lab analysis results (usually in pdf)
- letters of referrals from doctors
- hospital discharge letters 
- images of exams that take place at radiology
- medication summaries and instructions
- ...

Now, I was particularly interested in the imaging data. From CoZo, these are displayed in a third party platform called [Sectra Uniview](https://medical.sectra.com/product/sectra-uniview/). The experience online is really smooth (though it's always best to let a physician walk you through medical data), but when you download the dataset, the only option is - of course - to store it as a DICOM dataset.
