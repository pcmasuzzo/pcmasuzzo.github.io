## how big is my tumor?
If you receive a breast cancer diagnosis, one of the first questions that pop to your mind is going to be: _how bad is it?_ - which mostly translates to the question: _how big is it?_

Knowing how big your tumor is, together with an assessment of the status of health of your lymph nodes, will help determine more clearly the stage, prognosis, and treatment plan for your cancer.
Now, you might think that getting the _actual_ measurement of a tumor in a breast is an easy task, but it is not. In order to obtain a faithful picture, three measurements are usually correlated. The first, approximate measurement comes from an _echography_, which is then often followed by a _mammography_, and finally also by a _magnetic resonance imaging_ (MRI). The last exam is the one that supplies the most accurate measurement.

Knowing the size of the tumor is crucial not only to design the treatment plan, but also to understand if the treatment is working: if chemotherapy is doing what it's supposed to be doing, the tumor will shrink down. How much and how fast is impossible to predict, but the direction - the tumor becoming smaller and smaller - is clear.
