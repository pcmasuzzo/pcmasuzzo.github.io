# I GOT UP

Welcome to the **I GOT UP** project. I started this project around june 2025 and finished it off around august 2025. The idea behind it is that "**TODAY IS TODAY**" and that only this moment really matters in life.

I explain the scope and life of the project in [this newsletter](https://paolamasuzzo.substack.com/p/oggi-e-oggi).
In short, I reproduced the [I GOT UP](https://flashbak.com/creativity-from-boredom-and-routine-on-kawaras-i-got-up-postcards-1968-1979-418177/)
series from the japanese artist [On Kawara](https://onkawara.co.uk/styled-96/) and recorded the time at which I got up, every day, for a whole month, on a series
of postcards. I then shipped the postcards to some of my newsletters readers and friends, and they sent me back pictures of the cards in their favorite places.

Here is the collection!
