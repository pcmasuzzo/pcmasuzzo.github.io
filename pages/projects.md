I have to be honest, I am not sure what classifies as a project :D
but here are some things that keep me busy and help me navigate existential dread.

### I GOT UP
I copied the japanese artist On Kawara and stamped 31 postcards with the exact hour in which I got up for the whole month of july 2025.

[have a look at the collection here](/pages/i-got-up/)

### letter to my body
I have written a letter to myself, the physical part of me.

[find it here](/pages/letter-to-my-body/)

### my cancer archive
I didn't put this up in the _about_ section, but a big part of my identity boils down to me being a triple negative breast cancer survivor. During my active cancer treatment - the hardest time of my life - I found solace in writing and in data, and sometimes in the combination of the two.

This is my attempt at constructing my cancer archive.
