I have to be honest, I am not sure what classifies as a project eheh; here are some things that keep me busy and help me navigate existential dread.

## I GOT UP
I copied the japanese artist [On Kawara](https://onkawara.co.uk/styled-96/) and stamped 31 postcards with the exact hour in which I got up for the whole month of july 2025. [Have a look at the collection here](/pages/i-got-up/).

## cancer data
I didn't put this up in my _about_ section. I am a **triple negative breast cancer survivor**. During my active treatment - the hardest time of my life - I found solace in writing and in data, and mostly in the combination of the two. [Go explore what this all has meant for me](/pages/cancer.md).
